# Novusk
Novusk - A kernel written in Rust inspired by Linux

The [``master``](https://github.com/NathanMcMillan54/novusk/tree/master) branch is always being used to make the next 
version of Novusk, right now it's being used for mostly drivers. Read 
[this](https://github.com/NathanMcMillan54/novusk/issues/13) issue for a list of important drivers that are needed.
